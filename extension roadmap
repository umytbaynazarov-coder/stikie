# Stikie Chrome Extension Roadmap

> Chrome New Tab extension for [stikie.net](https://stikie.net) — quick-capture sticky notes on every new tab, synced to your stikie workspace.

---

## V1 — Backend & Sync Infrastructure (stikie.net)

> **The extension doesn't exist yet.** This phase builds the foundation that makes the extension valuable.

### What Needs to Happen

- [ ] Backend API for stikie.net (REST or similar)
  - `GET /notes` — fetch all notes
  - `POST /notes` — create a note
  - `PUT /notes/:id` — update a note
  - `DELETE /notes/:id` — delete a note
- [ ] Auth system (Google OAuth, email/password, or magic link)
- [ ] Database (migrate from localStorage-only to server-persisted)
- [ ] Offline-first sync on stikie.net itself (local-first, syncs when online)
- [ ] User accounts on stikie.net

### Why This Comes First

Without this, the extension is a disconnected toy. With this, every note captured in the extension feeds into stikie.net — creating a real product loop.

---

## V2 — Chrome Extension MVP (Quick Capture)

> The extension is a **capture tool**, not a workspace. Users open a new tab, jot a thought in 2 seconds, and move on. Notes sync to stikie.net.

### Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Architecture | Connected to stikie.net | Notes sync — this is the whole point |
| Storage | `chrome.storage.local` + API sync | Offline-first, syncs when online |
| Auth | Google OAuth via `chrome.identity` | One-click sign-in, no passwords |
| Manifest | V3 | Required for Chrome Web Store |
| Framework | Vanilla JS | Fast load on every new tab |
| Permissions | `storage`, `identity`, `host_permissions` for stikie.net | Minimal but needs auth + API access |

### V2 Features

- [ ] New tab override — clean, minimal page
- [ ] **Quick capture input** — text field at center, type and hit Enter, note saves instantly
- [ ] Rotating greeting messages:
  - "Got an idea? Type it before it's gone."
  - "Quick — what were you just thinking?"
  - "Don't forget that thought. Capture it."
  - "Your brain called. It said write this down."
  - "One note now saves ten minutes later."
- [ ] Recently captured notes shown below as small tiles (read-only, glanceable)
- [ ] Notes sync to stikie.net in background
- [ ] "Open in Stikie" link on each note tile → opens stikie.net
- [ ] Stikie branding (subtle logo + link)
- [ ] Offline support — saves locally, syncs when back online
- [ ] Keyboard-first: tab opens → cursor already in input → type → Enter → done

### What It Does NOT Have (Intentionally)

- No clock
- No full notes editor
- No drag/reposition
- No themes or customization
- No canvas backgrounds
- No font switching
- No search
- No archive

### UX Flow

```
1. User opens new tab
2. Clean page with greeting + centered text input
3. User types a thought, hits Enter
4. Note saves instantly (local + syncs to stikie.net)
5. Note appears as small tile below the input
6. User continues to address bar to search/navigate
   Total time: 2-3 seconds
```

### File Structure

```
stikie-extension/
├── manifest.json
├── newtab.html
├── newtab.js
├── newtab.css
├── sync.js              # API sync logic
├── icons/
│   ├── icon16.png
│   ├── icon48.png
│   └── icon128.png
└── README.md
```

### Permissions Breakdown

| Permission | What users see | Why needed |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| `storage` | No warning | Save notes locally |
| `identity` | "Know your email address" | Google sign-in |
| `host_permissions: stikie.net` | "Read and change your data on stikie.net" | API sync |

### Gotchas

- Only ONE extension can override new tab — conflicts with Momentum, etc.
- `chrome.storage.local` is separate from stikie.net's localStorage — different origins
- New tab must load < 100ms — no heavy frameworks
- Sync failures should be silent — never block the capture flow
- Auth token stored in `chrome.storage.local`, refreshed silently

---

## Technical Notes

### Performance Budget

New tab pages must be instant:
- First paint: < 100ms
- Interactive: < 200ms
- Capture-to-saved: < 50ms (local), sync in background
- No heavy frameworks
- Preload recent notes from `chrome.storage` on page load

### Key Chrome APIs

| API | Version | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `chrome.storage.local` | V2+ | Persist notes locally (up to 10MB) |
| `chrome.storage.sync` | V3+ | Sync settings across Chrome instances (up to 100KB) |
| `chrome.identity` | V2+ | Google OAuth sign-in |
| `chrome.commands` | V4+ | Keyboard shortcuts |
| `chrome.sidePanel` | V5+ | Side panel UI (Chrome 114+) |
| `chrome.action` | V4+ | Extension icon popup |

### Revenue Model

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Funnel to stikie.net | Extension is free, drives sign-ups to stikie.net |
| Free + Premium | Free capture, paid themes/unlimited sync/advanced features |
